# n8n-learning
A documentation of my applied work learning n8n workflows while taking the course "Build Intelligent Agents Using DeepSeek &amp; N8N" on Coursera

This repository documents my applied work learning **n8n** through Coursera.  
Each step will include exported workflows and notes.

## Workflows
