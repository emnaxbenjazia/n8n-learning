# Workflow: AI Agent Summarizes Articles and Saves to Notion

## Overview
This workflow uses **n8n** to automate the process of summarizing online articles using AI and organizing them into a **Notion database**, with automatic **Discord notifications** once a summary is ready.  

It integrates:
- **Browserless** for web scraping  
- **OpenAI Agent** for intelligent summarization  
- **Notion API** for structured knowledge management  
- **Discord Webhook** for notifications

## Workflow Steps

### 1. **Trigger**
- The workflow starts when you send a **URL** in the AI chat window (using the **Chat Trigger** node).  
- The input must be the URL of an article or blog post.

---

### 2. **AI Agent (OpenAI Chat Model)**
- Manages all reasoning and decision-making through the **AI Agent** node connected to an **OpenAI Chat Model**.  
- The system prompt defines clear instructions:
  1. Scrape the article using the `website_scraper` tool (Browserless).  
  2. Summarize its key content, identify the main theme, and generate structured metadata.  
  3. Save the summary and metadata to Notion using the `save_to_notion` tool.  
  4. Send a Discord notification confirming completion.

### 3. **Website Scraper (Browserless HTTP Request)**

- Uses **Browserless**, running in a separate Docker container, to fetch the article content.  
- The request body is configured in the **HTTP Request** node. The AI Agent dynamically provides the URL to scrape.

  json  
  {
    "url": "{url}",
    "gotoOptions": {
      "waitUntil": "networkidle0"
    }
  }

- The variable **{url}** is automatically replaced by the URL received from the chat input node.
- The Browserless node returns the raw HTML of the article, which the AI Agent then summarizes.

---

### 4. **Notion Integration**

- The **Notion** node receives the structured information generated by the AI Agent and creates a new entry in your **Research Summaries** database.
- Each entry contains:
  - **Title:** The original title of the article, optionally with an emoji.
  - **Summary:** A short summary of 1–3 sentences describing the main idea.
  - **URL:** The original article link.
  - **Theme:** The general topic or domain automatically detected by the AI.

- The AI Agent sends this data using the following mappings:

  - Title → $fromAI("Title", "The original title of the article", "string")
  - Summary → $fromAI("Summary", "1–3 sentence summary of the article", "string")
  - URL → $fromAI("URL", "The article URL", "string")
  - Theme → $fromAI("Theme", "The main topic identified by the AI", "string")

- Once executed, this node automatically inserts the generated values into your Notion database.

---

### 5. **Discord Notification**

- The **Discord Webhook** node sends a confirmation message to your Discord channel when the summary has been successfully saved to Notion.  
- The message is generated dynamically by the AI Agent and includes:
  - A friendly confirmation text.
  - The article title.
  - The article theme.
  - The original URL.

- Example message:

  Hello! Your article summary is ready in your Notion Database.  
  Article: [Title of the Article]  
  Theme: [Detected Theme]  
  URL: [Article URL]

- The message also includes **Embeds** to make it more visual, such as:
  - **Title:** The article title, clickable to open the source.
  - **Description:** “Summary saved to Notion.”
  - **Color:** Custom color for the message.
  - **Footer:** Displays the AI-generated theme or topic.

### Example Use Case

This workflow automatically summarizes blog posts, research papers, and news articles.  
It stores the summarized data in Notion and sends an instant notification to Discord.  
In short, it acts as your **personal AI research assistant**.

**Perfect for:**
- AI and tech researchers  
- Content curators  
- Students managing reading lists  
- Newsletter writers
